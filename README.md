Tutorial 1 - Group 2

## Getting Started

Please set up the backend to listen to http://localhost:3000 first before setting up the sample UI.

### Backend
* Deploy the composer network using pledge-chain.bna. The backend folder is not necessary and included for quick reference.
* Start the Composer REST server on port 3000.

### User UI
* Download NodeJS from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
* Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* `cd pc-frontend`
* Get node modules using `npm install`
* `ng serve`

If the Webpack compilation fails, open a file in /pc-frontend/src/app (e.g. /pc-frontend/src/app/ProjectDetails/ProjectDetails.component.ts) in a text editor and save it without making any changes. This triggers Hot Module Replacement and the compilation should subsequently succeed.
